//Debugging

//Searching for errors in programming code is called debugging
//There are different ways to debug something
	//Putting in breakpoints
	//"debugger" statement
		//This stops the execution of JavaScript and calls the available debugging function
//All browsers should have there own debugging


//Example
var x = 15;
var y = 5;
var z = x + y;
debugger;
document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = z;
